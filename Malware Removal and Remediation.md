# Malware Removal and Remediation

This is a very simple simulation of how to scan for malware and remove using the Windows Security Features.

In this lab I will be:
- Scanning for malware
- Analyzing and removing malware
- Implementing malware removal best practices

## Scanning for Malware

First I will pull the EICAR test string to do my analysis.

I put the string in a text document to test our malware scanner.

Next I run a custom scan through windows security.

The scan was able to detect the EICAR test string. Ensuring that anti virus software is operating as expected.

## Analyze and Remove Malware

Once discovered we are able to review the details of the "malware" within the windows security settings.

We then remove the file.

## Implement Malware Removal Best Practices

Now we will be creating a point in time configuration(snapshot) that could be used to revert the machine to a previous state(before the malware was installed).

- Opened System Settings and accessed Advanced System Settings
- Navigated to the System Protection tab
- Enabled System Protection for Local Disk (C:)
- Configured restore settings to allow restore point creation
- Created a restore point labeled “Initial remediation point”
- Waited for the restore point creation process to complete successfully
- Opened the System Restore wizard to verify the restore point
- Confirmed the restore point appeared in the available restore list


## Conclusion

This lab demonstrated the full lifecycle of basic malware response: detection, analysis, removal, and post-remediation protection. By using the EICAR test string, I verified that Windows Security was functioning properly and capable of detecting malicious files. After identifying the threat, I reviewed its details and safely removed it from the system.

Most importantly, I implemented remediation best practices by enabling System Restore and creating a restore point. This ensures the system can be rolled back to a known clean state if future issues occur.

Malware analysis and removal are critical because early detection minimizes system damage, protects sensitive data, and reduces downtime. Proper remediation — including restoring safeguards — strengthens overall system resilience and prepares the environment for future security incidents.
